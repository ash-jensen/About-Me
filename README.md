About Me Site

This site is one of the first projects I did in an intro to HTML/CSS class at Santa Monica College. I learned how to create HTML pages with text,
links, images, lists, tables and forms. Applying CSS to separate style and content, creating inline, embedded, and linked styles sheets, and how to
apply structure, rules, and inheritance of CSS were also covered.
